# Smart Taxi Driver Problem - Approach 1

## Problem Statement

You are given a tree-like representation of a city, where each node represents a location, and edges represent roads connecting locations. The following information is provided:

- `N`: The total number of locations in the city.
- `K`: The maximum distance the taxi driver can travel before they must stop working.
- `P`: An array of size `N`, where `P[i]` represents the parent node of location `i` in the tree. The root of the tree is location `1`, and its parent is `0`.
- `C`: An array of size `N`, where `C[i]` represents the distance or cost of traveling along the road connecting location `i` to its parent `P[i]`.
- `T`: An array of size `N`, where `T[i]` represents the destination location of the person currently at location `i`. If `T[i]` is `0`, it means there is no one at location `i` needing a ride.

The taxi driver starts at location `1` (the root of the tree) and follows this process:

1. If there's a person at the current location (`T[current location] > 0`):
   - Calculate the distance to the person's destination.
   - If the driver has enough remaining distance to travel to the destination, drop the person off there, and then return to the root location (`1`).
   - Increment the count of people served.

2. Explore other locations connected to the current location (excluding the parent location, to avoid going back).

The taxi driver cannot travel more than a total distance of `K`.

### Task

Write a function to determine the maximum number of people the taxi driver can transport to their destinations.

### Input

- `N`: An integer representing the number of locations.
- `K`: An integer representing the maximum travel distance for the taxi driver.
- `P`: An array representing the parent nodes of each location.
- `C`: An array representing the distances of the roads.
- `T`: An array representing the destinations of people at each location.

### Output

- An integer representing the maximum number of people the taxi driver can serve.

### Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq K \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq P[i] < i \quad \text{for } 1 \leq i \leq N$
- $1 \leq C[i] \leq 10^4 \quad \text{for } 1 \leq i \leq N$
- $0 \leq T[i] \leq N \quad \text{for } 1 \leq i \leq N$

## Approach

### Approach 1: Cost Calculation and Knapsack Algorithm

To solve this problem, we take the following steps:

1. **Calculate the Cost to Transport Each Passenger**:
   - We calculate the minimum cost required to transport each passenger from their starting location to their destination and then back to the root node (`1`).
   - This is done by traversing from each destination node up to the root, accumulating costs along the way, and then using these costs to compute the round trip cost.

2. **Construct a Minimum Cost Map**:
   - We construct a map where each entry stores the minimum cost required to reach each destination from any node in the tree.
   - This map helps in efficiently calculating the total travel cost required for each passenger.

3. **Knapsack Algorithm to Maximize Passengers**:
   - Once we have the cost for each passenger, we apply a greedy approach similar to the knapsack algorithm.
   - The idea is to sort the calculated costs and pick as many passengers as possible without exceeding the maximum travel distance `K`.

### Python Implementation

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def calculate_minimum_cost_map(P, C, destinations):
    N = len(P)
    cost_map = [defaultdict(int) for _ in range(N)]

    for dest in destinations:
        if dest > 0:
            current_node = dest
            current_cost = 0
            while current_node > 0:
                cost_map[current_node][dest] = current_cost
                current_cost += C[current_node]
                current_node = P[current_node]

    return cost_map

def calculate_transport_cost(source, dest, P, C, cost_map):
    cost = 0
    current_source = source
    while dest not in cost_map[current_source]:
        cost += C[current_source]
        current_source = P[current_source]

    return cost + cost_map[current_source][dest]

def max_passengers(costs, K):
    costs.sort()
    count = 0
    for cost in costs:
        if cost <= K:
            K -= cost
            count += 1
        else:
            break
    return count

def max_people_served(N, K, P, C, T):
    cost_map = calculate_minimum_cost_map(P, C, T)
    costs = []
    for i in range(1, N):
        if T[i] > 0:
            min_cost = calculate_transport_cost(i, T[i], P, C, cost_map)
            round_trip_cost = cost_map[1][i] + min_cost + cost_map[1][T[i]]
            costs.append(round_trip_cost)

    return max_passengers(costs, K)

# Example usage:
N = 9
K = 94
P = [0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6]        # P[i] gives the parent of node i
C = [0, 0, 10, 15, 20, 10, 5, 25, 8, 12]  # C[i] gives the cost from node i to its parent
T = [0, 0, 5, 6, 0, 8, 0, 9, 0, 4]        # T[i] gives the destination of the person at node i

result = max_people_served(N, K, P, C, T)
print(result)  # Expected output: 1
```

### Explanation of the Simplified Python Code:

1. **Cost Map Calculation** (`calculate_minimum_cost_map`):
   - We build a cost map (`cost_map`) for each node to store the cost of traveling from any node to its descendants that are marked as destinations.
   - This map helps in quickly looking up the cost to transport a passenger.

2. **Transport Cost Calculation** (`calculate_transport_cost`):
   - This function computes the cost of transporting a passenger from the source node to the destination node.
   - If the source and destination share a common ancestor, it calculates the cost by first moving up to that ancestor and then moving down to the destination.

3. **Knapsack-like Greedy Algorithm** (`max_passengers`):
   - The costs of all potential trips are sorted, and we then try to transport as many passengers as possible within the travel distance `K`.
   - The algorithm picks the cheapest trips first, maximizing the number of passengers served.

4. **Main Function** (`max_people_served`):
   - This function orchestrates the above steps: calculating the cost map, determining the trip costs, and then using the knapsack-like algorithm to find the maximum number of passengers that can be transported.

### Key Simplifications:
- **Simplified Cost Calculation**: The function `calculate_transport_cost` hides the complexity of finding common ancestors and calculating the exact costs, making the logic more straightforward.
- **Clearer Structure**: The functions are broken down into small, easy-to-understand pieces, each handling a specific part of the problem.

This Python code provides a simplified and intuitive implementation of the approach you outlined, making it easier to understand while retaining the essential logic.

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the input:

- `N = 9` (number of locations)
- `K = 94` (maximum travel distance)
- `P = [0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6]` (parent locations)
- `C = [0, 0, 10, 15, 20, 10, 5, 25, 8, 12]` (travel costs)
- `T = [0, 0, 5, 6, 0, 8, 0, 9, 0, 4]` (destinations of passengers)

The `maxPeopleServed` function will output the maximum number of people that can be transported within the distance limit `K`.

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity for calculating the cost map is \(O(N^2)\), and the knapsack algorithm runs in \(O(N \log N)\) due to sorting, followed by a linear pass. 
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(N^2)\) for storing the cost map, making the solution less optimal for very large inputs.

This implementation is straightforward but may not be completely optimized.

### Conclusion

This approach calculates the transportation cost for each passenger and then applies a knapsack-like algorithm to maximize the number of passengers the taxi driver can transport within the travel distance limit. While effective for many cases, this solution might require further optimization for very large trees or high constraints.
