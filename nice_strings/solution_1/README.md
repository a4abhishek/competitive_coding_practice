## Approach

The solution is based on dynamic programming, specifically inspired by the [Count Vowels Permutation](../../count_vowels_permutation/) problem.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table (dp):**
   - The code uses a map `dp` where `dp[i][r]` represents the number of "nice strings" of length `i` that end with the character `r`, where `r` is either 'L' or 'R'.
   - `dp[i]['L']`: Number of nice strings of length `i` ending with 'L'.
   - `dp[i]['R']`: Number of nice strings of length `i` ending with 'R'.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - For `n = 1`, there are two possible "nice strings": `"R"` and `"L"`, each counted separately.
   - For `n = 2`, there are three "nice strings": `"RR"`, `"RL"`, and `"LR"`. The string `"LL"` is not allowed.

3. **Recursive Computation:**
   - For a string of length `n` ending with 'L', it must have an `(n-1)` length prefix that ends with 'R'. Therefore:
     - `dp[n]['L'] = dp[n-1]['R']`
   - For a string of length `n` ending with 'R', it can have an `(n-1)` length prefix ending with either 'L' or 'R'. Thus:
     - `dp[n]['R'] = dp[n-1]['L'] + dp[n-1]['R']`
   - Each calculation is done modulo $10^9 + 7$ to avoid overflow.

4. **Counting Nice Strings for Length `n`:**
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, calculate the total number of nice strings of length `i` as:
     $$G(i) = dp[i]['L'] + dp[i]['R']$$
   - The final result is the sum of squares of `G(i)` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, i.e.,:
     $$\text{Result} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} G(i)^2 \mod (10^9 + 7)$$

5. **Result Calculation:**
   - The function `calculateSumOfSquares(n)` computes the sum of squares of the counts of nice strings for each length up to `n`, modulo $10^9 + 7$.
   - This is the required output, representing the sum $G(1)^2 + G(2)^2 + \dots + G(n)^2 \mod (10^9 + 7)$.

## Code Explanation

```python
MOD = 1000000007

# Dictionary to memoize the results of subproblems
dp = {}

def count_nice_strings_ends_with(n, r):
    # Base cases
    if n == 1:
        return 1  # For strings of length 1, both 'R' and 'L' are valid
    
    if n == 2:
        if r == 'L':
            return 1  # Only "RL" is valid if the string ends with 'L'
        return 2  # "RR" and "LR" are valid if the string ends with 'R'
    
    # Check if the result is already computed
    if (n, r) in dp:
        return dp[(n, r)]

    count = 0
    if r == 'L':
        # A nice string of length n ending with 'L' must follow an 'R'
        count += count_nice_strings_ends_with(n-1, 'R')
    elif r == 'R':
        # A nice string of length n ending with 'R' can follow either 'L' or 'R'
        count += count_nice_strings_ends_with(n-1, 'L')
        count += count_nice_strings_ends_with(n-1, 'R')
    
    # Ensure the count is within the MOD limit
    count %= MOD
    
    # Memoize the result
    dp[(n, r)] = count
    
    return count

def calculate_sum_of_squares(n):
    total_sum = 0

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        g_i = 0
        g_i += count_nice_strings_ends_with(i, 'L')
        g_i += count_nice_strings_ends_with(i, 'R')

        total_sum += g_i * g_i
        total_sum %= MOD
    
    return total_sum

# Example Usage
n = 5
print(calculate_sum_of_squares(n))
```

### Explanation of the Python Code:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - When `n = 1`: There are two possible nice strings (`"R"` and `"L"`), so the function returns 1 for both 'R' and 'L'.
   - When `n = 2`: 
     - If the string ends with 'L', only `"RL"` is valid (`count = 1`).
     - If the string ends with 'R', both `"RR"` and `"LR"` are valid (`count = 2`).

2. **Memoization:**
   - The `dp` dictionary is used to store already computed results for specific values of `n` and the ending character `r`. This avoids recalculating results, making the solution more efficient.

3. **Recursive Case:**
   - The function `count_nice_strings_ends_with` calculates the number of nice strings of length `n` ending with 'L' or 'R' based on the values for `n-1`.
   - For 'L', the previous character must be 'R'.
   - For 'R', the previous character can be either 'L' or 'R'.

4. **Sum of Squares:**
   - `calculate_sum_of_squares(n)` computes the sum of the squares of the number of nice strings for each length from 1 to `n`, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Modulus Operation:**
   - The modulo operation (`% MOD`) is applied to ensure that the numbers do not overflow and remain within the required limits.

This Python version of the code retains the same logic as the original Go code but in a format that may be more intuitive for those familiar with Python.

## Conclusion

This solution leverages dynamic programming, inspired by the [Count Vowels Permutation](../../count_vowels_permutation/) approach, to count sequences with specific restrictions efficiently. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using memoization, we avoid redundant calculations, making the solution both time and space efficient. The time complexity of the solution is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the longest sequence, and the space complexity is also \(O(N)\) due to the storage of intermediate results. This method is highly effective and can be applied to similar problems involving constrained sequence generation.
