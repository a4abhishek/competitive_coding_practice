# Approach (Iterative Fibbonacci)

## Understanding `G(I)`

`G(I)` represents the count of all "nice" strings of length `I`. The sequence `G(I)` follows a recurrence relation similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with specific initial conditions. A "nice" string is defined as any string that does not contain consecutive 'L' characters.

- **Base Cases:**
  - `G(1) = 2` (Strings: "R", "L")
  - `G(2) = 3` (Strings: "RR", "RL", "LR"; "LL" is not allowed)

- **Recursive Formula:**
  - A "nice" string of length `I` can be constructed by:
    1. Appending 'R' to any valid string of length `I-1`.
    2. Appending 'RL' to any valid string of length `I-2` (this ensures no consecutive 'L's).
  
  Thus, the recurrence relation is:
  $$G(I) = G(I-1) + G(I-2)$$
  
  This results in a Fibonacci-like sequence with the distinct initial values of `G(1) = 2` and `G(2) = 3`.

## Task Requirement

The problem requires us to compute the sum of the squares of these values for all lengths from 1 to `N`:

$$ G(1)^2 + G(2)^2 + \dots + G(N)^2 \mod (10^9 + 7) $$

## Solution Approach

1. **Iterative Calculation of `G(I)`**:
   - Instead of using recursion, we calculate `G(I)` iteratively, taking advantage of the Fibonacci-like relationship.
   - We only store the last two values of the sequence (`G(I-1)` and `G(I-2)`), which significantly reduces memory usage.

2. **Sum of Squares**:
   - As we calculate each `G(I)`, we immediately compute its square and add it to the cumulative sum.
   - The sum is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow and meet problem constraints.

## Example Implementation in Go

```go
def calculate_sum_of_squares(n):
    MOD = 1000000007

    if n == 1:
        return 4  # Square of 2
    if n == 2:
        return 4 + 9  # Squares of 2 and 3

    # Starting values corresponding to the first two terms in the sequence
    gp, gn = 2, 3
    c = gp**2 + gn**2  # Initial sum of squares for the first two terms

    for i in range(3, n+1):
        gp, gn = gn, gp + gn  # Generate next term
        c += gn**2  # Add square of the new term
        c %= MOD  # Take modulo at each step

    return c

print(calculate_sum_of_squares(5))
```

## Explanation of Approach

- **Base Cases**:
  - For `n = 1`, the only possible nice strings are "R" and "L", so `G(1)^2 = 2^2 = 4`.
  - For `n = 2`, the possible nice strings are "RR", "RL", and "LR", so `G(2)^2 = 3^2 = 9`.

- **Iterative Calculation**:
  - We begin by initializing `G(1) = 2` and `G(2) = 3`.
  - For each subsequent `I`, we use the recurrence relation to compute `G(I) = G(I-1) + G(I-2)`.
  - Simultaneously, we compute and accumulate the sum of squares, applying the modulo operation to ensure we stay within limits.

- **Efficiency**:
  - This approach only stores two variables at a time (`G(I-1)` and `G(I-2)`), making it space-efficient.
  - The iterative nature ensures that the solution runs in linear time `O(N)`.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)` — We iterate through each value from `1` to `N` to compute `G(I)` and the sum of squares.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` — We only maintain two variables (`gp` and `gn`) to store consecutive values of the Fibonacci-like sequence, making the space usage constant.

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently computes the sum of squares of the counts of "nice" strings using an iterative method, which avoids the overhead of recursion and minimizes memory usage. The solution ensures that we stay within the problem's constraints by using modular arithmetic and leverages the structure of a Fibonacci-like sequence to simplify the calculation.
