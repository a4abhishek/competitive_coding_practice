# Approach (Reccursive Fibbonacci)

## Understanding `G(I)`

`G(I)` represents the count of all nice strings of length `I`. This problem can be related to a modified Fibonacci sequence:

- **Base Cases:**
  - `G(1) = 2` (Strings: "R", "L")
  - `G(2) = 3` (Strings: "RR", "RL", "LR"; "LL" is not allowed)

- **Recursive Formula:**
  - To construct a nice string of length `I`, you can:
    1. Append 'R' to any nice string of length `I-1` (keeping all valid strings from `G(I-1)`).
    2. Append 'RL' to a nice string of length `I-2` (to avoid consecutive 'L's).

  Therefore, the recursive relation is:
  $$G(I) = G(I-1) + G(I-2)$$
  This is a Fibonacci-like sequence where each term is the sum of the previous two terms, but with different initial conditions.

## Task Requirement

Given the recursive nature of `G(I)`, the task reduces to:

1. Compute `G(I)` for each `1 <= I <= N`.
2. Compute the sum $G(1)^2 + G(2)^2 + \dots + G(N)^2 \mod (10^9 + 7)$.

## Solution Approach

1. **Precompute `G(I)` values:**
   - Use dynamic programming to compute `G(I)` up to `N` using the Fibonacci-like recurrence.

2. **Sum the squares of `G(I)` values:**
   - Calculate the sum $G(1)^2 + G(2)^2 + \dots + G(N)^2 \mod (10^9 + 7)$.

## Example Implementation in Python

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def calculate_sum_of_squares(N):
    if N == 1:
        return 4  # G(1)^2 = 2^2 = 4
    
    G = [0] * (N + 1)
    G[1], G[2] = 2, 3
    
    sum_of_squares = G[1]**2 + G[2]**2
    
    for i in range(3, N + 1):
        G[i] = (G[i-1] + G[i-2]) % MOD
        sum_of_squares = (sum_of_squares + G[i]**2) % MOD
    
    return sum_of_squares

# Example Usage
N = 10
result = calculate_sum_of_squares(N)
print(result)
```

## Explanation of Approach

- **Why Fibonacci?**:
  The relationship between consecutive elements in `G(I)` mimics the Fibonacci sequence because constructing valid strings for `G(I)` depends on the valid strings for `G(I-1)` and `G(I-2)`.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  The modulo operation is used to keep numbers manageable and prevent overflow, as well as to meet the problem's constraints.

## Conclusion

The problem effectively leverages the properties of Fibonacci-like sequences to count specific types of strings and then sum their squares. The approach is both mathematically interesting and computationally efficient, with a time complexity of `O(N)` due to the dynamic programming step.
